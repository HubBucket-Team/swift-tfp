* Implement verification for all paths through the program
* Simplification through shape indexing
* Support for explicit init inside structs
* More efficient verification (e.g. start with roots and only descend if failures are found)
* Be more correct wrt. not treating everything as shapes
  - We shouldn't warn if we fail to recover asserts that for sure don't have anything to do with shapes
  - We shouldn't assume that every list of ints we see has to have non-negative entries...
