* Control flow support
* Figure out how to better deal with shape equality constraints under guards
  - Perhaps we could still resolve them if all uses of one variable are guarded under a
    conditon that's implied by the equality guard.
* Simplification through shape indexing (when a shape is only used in indexing)
* Support for explicit init inside structs
* More efficient verification (e.g. start with roots and only descend if failures are found)
* Be more correct wrt. not treating everything as shapes
  - We shouldn't warn if we fail to recover asserts that for sure don't have anything to do with shapes
  - We shouldn't assume that every list of ints we see has to have non-negative entries...
