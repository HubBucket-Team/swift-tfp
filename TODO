* Arithmetic support
* Call graph analysis (topological sort)
* More efficient verification (e.g. start with roots and only descend if failures are found)
* Propagation of constrant values through function calls (just Int would be already helpful)
* Recovery of contradictory assertions from SMT unsat proofs
* Support for inequalities
* Use unoptimized SIL
* Negative dimension indices
* Propagation of source information through the system
* Support for structs
* Emit warnings from the frontend
* Control flow support
