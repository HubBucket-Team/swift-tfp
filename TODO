* Clean up .literal(2) now that IntExpr conforms to ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral
* Propagation of source information through the system
* Emit warnings from the frontend
* Simplification through shape indexing (when a shape is only used in indexing)
* Shape holes
* Support for explicit init inside structs
* Control flow support
* More efficient verification (e.g. start with roots and only descend if failures are found)
