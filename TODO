* Support for array literals
* Support for regular assertions
* Broadcasting
* Shape equality (it's a bit complex to represent at the Z3 level)
* Propagation of abstract values through function calls (just Int would be already helpful)
* Negative dimension indices
* Support for structs
* Propagation of source information through the system
* Emit warnings from the frontend
* Control flow support
* More efficient verification (e.g. start with roots and only descend if failures are found)
